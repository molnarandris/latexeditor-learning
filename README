This is my latex editor. Managed to un-flatpak from builder as I had trouble with texlive.

# Installation

GSettings:
cp apps.gsettings-example-py.gschema.xml /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/
glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/


# Uninstall:

Undo the install


# Run

Right now it's just `python main.py`
