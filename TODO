*Next things to do

  - At compilation error, if changing window and changing back, the pdf disappears. Maybe I should do sth with that.
    Well, I should actually display the error message.
  - I think there is a bug: compile with error, close the program, open it, correct the error and try to compile again, then the pdf is None.
  - At resizing pdf does not keep its position
  - Gtk side of command completion.
  - Stack for log viewing


*Concrete but not so urgent

  - Some nicer way for the state saver, saving the current file is function calling. Maybe rewrite it to signals.
  - Synctex is not ready. 
    - Highlight line in editor
    - highlight region in pdf
    - Synctex backwards through command line never worked: offset is always 0.
    - Something is still a bit off with synctex forward. 
 
*Future plans

  - Handling compilation errors
  - Some kind of command completion
  - git support
  - Render equations inline
  - Render tikz inline
  - Some drawing thing
  - Possibly a wysiwyg latex editing widget
