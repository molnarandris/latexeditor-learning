*Next things to do

  - Refine the basic command completion. Understand more how it works.
  - Log parsing: Errors start with !
  - Mark errors in source
  


*Concrete but not so urgent

  - Some nicer way for the state saver, saving the current file is function calling. Maybe rewrite it to signals.
  - Synctex is not ready. 
    - Highlight line in editor
    - highlight region in pdf
    - Synctex backwards through command line never worked: offset is always 0.
    - Something is still a bit off with synctex forward. 
 
*Future plans

  - Handling compilation errors
  - Some kind of command completion
  - git support
  - Render equations inline
  - Render tikz inline
  - Some drawing thing
  - Possibly a wysiwyg latex editing widget
