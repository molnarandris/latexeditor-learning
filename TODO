*Next things to do

  - At error, if changing window and changing back, the pdf disappears. Maybe I should do sth with that.
    Well, I should actually display the error message.
  - I think there is a bug: compile with error, close the program, open it, correct the error and try to compile again, then the pdf is None.
  - At resizing pdf does not keep its position


*Concrete but not so urgent

  - Double check the process runner, not sure if it actually works. Some point change it to be able to cancel (at some tikz errors latex goes to infinite loop)
  - Some nicer way for the state saver, the file is direct calling. Maybe rewrite it to signals.
 
*Future plans

  - Handling compilation errors
  - Some kind of command completion
  - git support
  - Render equations inline
  - Render tikz inline
  - Some drawing thing
  - Possibly a latex editing widget
