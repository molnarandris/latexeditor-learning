*Next things to do

  - Refine the basic command completion. Understand more how it works.
  - Log parsing: Errors start with !
  - Mark errors in source
  


*Concrete but not so urgent

  - Some nicer way for the state saver, saving the current file is function calling. Maybe rewrite it to signals.
  - Customize Synctex. Missing Evince functions?? 
 
*Future plans

  - Handling compilation errors
  - Some kind of command completion
  - git support
  - Render equations inline
  - Render tikz inline
  - Some drawing thing
  - Possibly a wysiwyg latex editing widget
  
* Parser

  - For completion etc. need some kind of parsing.
  - It shuld do incomplete stuff etc.
  - Should translate between DOM and position in the buffer.
